Passport Photo Studio - GitHub build ready

Files added: minimal Android skeleton + workflow.
How to create APK:
1. Commit these files to branch 'main'.
2. Go to Actions tab -> run the workflow (or push a commit).
3. After job completes, download artifact 'passport-photo-studio-debug-apk' -> you'll get the debug APK.

Note: This is a minimal skeleton with placeholders. Full CameraX + ML Kit integration can be added next.
